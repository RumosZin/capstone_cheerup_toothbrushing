## 🧐 Introduction

Hi, we are **Team Cappiler**!

The main purpose of the project was to solve the absence of **Awareness on the importance of toothbrushing**.

## ⛳ Purpose of this Project

Our 3 core goals are:

1. Make kids have **FUN** while brushing their teeth.
2. Make sure kids brush **all of the regions** in our mouth, in a **proper way**.
3. Help **parents assist** their kids to brush their teeth properly.

## 🔑 Key Features

With our app [Cheer-Up], you can make your tooth brusing time more FUN! You can brush your teeth on the right beat of the music you selected, in a form of a **Rhythm game**.

There is a **brushing area guide** that makes sure all areas are cleaned without exception.

After you finish the game, you can earn rewards, and use them for **buying various animal themes**, or **feed them to your tooth character**.

It provides a **brushing report for parents** to check their child's **insufficient brushing area!**
